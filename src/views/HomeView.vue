            Welcome to the Splatoon 3 Ability Analyzer. I wanted to make a tool for getting a better feeling of how many
            slots of a certain ability, it is worth using in your build. I don't intend to make a Build analyzer,
            because there is already a very good one on
            <a href="https://sendou.ink/analyzer">sendou.ink</a>. I used the data provided by
            <a href="https://twitter.com/LeanYoshi">Lean</a> you can visit their site
            <a href="https://leanny.github.io/">here</a>.
